# Image-Compression-with-JPEG-Codec-Using-Python
## Project Overview
This project focuses on the implementation and analysis of mechanisms used in image compression, particularly through the JPEG codec. The main goal is to gain sensitivity to fundamental aspects of image compression and understand the workings of the JPEG compression algorithm.

## Objectives
#### -Gain practical knowledge and understanding of image compression techniques, specifically the JPEG codec.
#### -Implement and analyze various stages of the JPEG compression process using Python.
#### -Explore image visualization, color space conversion, sub-sampling, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and quantization.
#### -Evaluate the effects of different compression settings on image quality and file size.

## Technologies Used
#### -Python
#### -NumPy, SciPy (for numerical operations and scientific computations)
#### -Matplotlib (for image visualization)
